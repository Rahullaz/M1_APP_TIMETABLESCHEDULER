# M1_APP_TIMETABLESCHEDULER
Introduction:
  In universities, automated timetables are used to arrange courses, lectures, and rooms while taking into account certain constraints. Timetables
that are inconvenient and ineffective frequently squander time and money. As a result, it's critical to look at the requirements and possible 
demands of users. As a result, eliciting University Timetable Management System user requirements and their implications becomes a crucial task 
for TMS implementation. On that basis, the purpose of this work is to offer a requirements model for the University Timetable Management System. 
This paradigm provides developers with a more effective and efficient platform for producing a high-quality TMS by combining quantitative and 
qualitative methods.
